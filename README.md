---

Steps

1. Import Dataset
   Load the dataset using pandas and perform basic exploration.

2. Preprocessing  
   Handle missing values, normalize/scale data if needed, and split into train/test sets.

3. Model Training  
   Fit a Linear Regression model using `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`.

4. Model Evaluation  
   Evaluate model performance using:
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - RÂ² Score

5. Visualization
   - Actual vs Predicted Plot
   - Residual Plot
   - Feature Importance Bar Chart (based on coefficients)

6. Interpretation
   - Extract and explain coefficients and intercept.
   - Discuss model assumptions and limitations.
